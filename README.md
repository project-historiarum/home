# Project Historiarum

Project Historiarum is an endeavor to bring historical pedagogy out from the 18th century, into the 21st. The intent is to create
better methods of teaching history and consuming historical content with the simplest and most powerful of tools out there: 
*code.*

## How did this start?

Web and mobile tech's being used to create newer pedagogical methods for natural sciences, language learning and more. But all along, historical learning has stayed the way it was two centuries ago - rote learning with absolutely **no** emphasis on a deeper understanding of historical events. This leads to a natural underappreciation for history's meaning in society, and its power as a dialectic tool - in many instances, it leads to a general distaste for all matters historical.

On a subliminal level, this project is all about exploring the deepest, darkest recesses of history, using more interactive methods as our flashlights. It's also about investigating the power and price of scholarly obsession with historial interests, and at what point historical content can be "democratized" without sacrificing its scholarly tones.

## What does this project entail?

At this point, Historiarum will be all about creating long-form writeups around very specific historical periods or themes, with interactive elements interspaced throughout the narrative, complementing it where needed. For now, these elements are limited to:

1. Timelines, allowing the reader to zoom into particular events with supporting rich media: images, audio/visual clips, documents.
2. Visualizations, which the reader can use to look at events with supporting datasets. Nothing like a data-backed story!

As can be inferred, Historiarum's an evolving experiment. Maybe at some point, standalone timelines and visualizations make a lot of sense. Maybe at some point, something else seems like **the thing** to work with. And that's the beauty of it - discovering what kind of tool enables scholarly history consumption with minimal barriers.
